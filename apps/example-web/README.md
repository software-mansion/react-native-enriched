# React Native Enriched Web Example

This is a [**Vite**](https://vite.dev) + [**React**](https://react.dev) web example for the React Native Enriched text input component, bootstrapped with Vite's React template.

# Getting Started

## Step 1: Install dependencies

From the root of the monorepo, install all workspace dependencies:

```sh
yarn install
```

## Step 2: Start the development server

Run the following command from the root of the monorepo or from the `apps/example-web` directory:

```sh
# From root - using Turbo
yarn example-web dev

# OR directly in this workspace
yarn dev
```

The app should now be running at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Step 3: Modify your app

Now that you have the development server running, let's make changes!

Open `src/App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and make some changes. When you save, your app will automatically update and reflect these changes.

## Build for production

To create an optimized production build:

```sh
yarn build:web
```

The built files will be in the `dist/` directory.

## Preview the production build

To preview the production build locally:

```sh
yarn preview
```
